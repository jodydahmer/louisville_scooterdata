Mapping and visualizing scooter data in Louisville using open source data from Louisville Metro 

Website for Open Source Data: https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/dockless-vehicles

Using open data, I will pull the major routes and overlay them with the major intersections of the "Awkward Maps" created by Beargrass Thunder mapping major intersections for potential transit

From Louisville Open Data Portal:

"There is no identifier for a company - instead all the trips are combined into one file. This is to protect the privacy of riders and to not release company "trade secrets" (eg, the placement and rides per company).

Includes the following fields:

TripID - a unique ID created by Louisville Metro
StartDate - in YYYY-MM-DD format
StartTime - rounded to the nearest 15 minutes in HH:MM format
EndDate - in YYYY-MM-DD format
EndTime - rounded to the nearest 15 minutes in HH:MM format
TripDuration - duration of the trip minutes
TripDistance - distance of trip in miles based on company route data
StartLatitude - rounded to nearest 3 decimal places
StartLongitude - rounded to nearest 3 decimal places
EndLatitude - rounded to nearest 3 decimal places
EndLongitude - rounded to nearest 3 decimal places
DayOfWeek - 1-7 based on date, 1 = Sunday through 7 = Saturday, useful for analysis

HourNum - the hour part of the time from 0-24 of the StartTime, useful for analysis "
